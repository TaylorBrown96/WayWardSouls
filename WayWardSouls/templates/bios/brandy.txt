I am from Hartington, NE originally I moved away to pursue a career in art and ended up here, in North Carolina. I love surreal and dreamlike art, especially when I get an opportunity to adorn someones body with it. 

Body modification holds a special place in my heart because it is life-changing, it is a reflection of the soul and enhances the way people walk in the world.
