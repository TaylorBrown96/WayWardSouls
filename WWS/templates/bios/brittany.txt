My main goal as a tattoo artist is to bring mental and spiritual healing back to the tattoo enviroment. I have been drawing since 5 years old and I have an Associates degree in Art and Art Theory. I am originally from Nebraska and moved to North Carolina to persue a career in art. I love reptiles and have 2 ball pythons and a Sulcata tortoise.
