Hello my name is Faith, I'm being forced against my will to write this biography, my captures name is Taylor. I'm married to him, my fault, now im stuck writing this. My location is Wayward Souls, great place BTW. So if anyone sees this visit me at Wayward Souls and save me from my capture Taylor. Also he is my husband of "choice".....JK. I'm from California I moved here in 2017, I apprenticed under my mom for 3 years and under Brittany and Brandy for 6 months. If you are interested with any of my work, book a consultation with me. Hope to see you soon!
