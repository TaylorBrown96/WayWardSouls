My name is Chelsea I've been a tattoo apprentice at Wayward Souls since January 2021. My passion for art and music began when I started elementary school and began taking art classes. I would focus solely on drawing and playing instruments more than on my own classwork, all the way through high school. Which was when I initially wanted to tattoo. Years of retail and food service jobs later, I started drawing more and taking my life goal more seriously, than I found Wayward Souls. I look forward to providing a safe, healthy, and sterile environment for you and your next tattoo!
